## Recipe Snap
A React Native mobile app that searches for recipes based on ingredients detected in food photos, created for the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy's 4-day Stackathon.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

If you want to run this app locally, clone this repo and choose an option below:

`npm start` - Runs your app in development mode. You can use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code to run it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

`npm run ios` - Just like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
